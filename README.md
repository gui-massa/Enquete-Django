Using django framework for creating a survey (study).

First when using Dango framework, it is necessary to create a virtual-enviromment (venv) to ensure the same versions are included here.  
It is important to note that pyCharm can create one easy venv for you, since it does authomatically.  
However, I recomment making your own venv with only the tools necessary for the project. There is tons of tutorials on how to do so.

The project here itself is merely for studying purposes, as it doesn't fully create a survey and all its possibilities in a presentable manner, but it does show the some main functionalities when using Django framework.
